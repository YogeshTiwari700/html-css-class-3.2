            <h1>1.How to Write A Marketing Email </h1>
            <p>
                There’s no doubt that email marketing is a powerful tool for any marketer. It’s an effective and simple way to nurture leads, retain customers and convert interest into a purchase. 

However, with so much content arriving in people’s inboxes on an hourly basis, it can be tough to stand out from the crowd. Anyone can write an email, but there’s an art to writing one that prompts clicks and conversions. 

So how do you write a good marketing email? In this blog, we will give you a step-by-step guide to creating an email that appeals to prospects and customers. 
            </p>
<h2>Step 1: Align messaging with the correct segment and stage in the funnel</h2>
<p>First and foremost, you need to know who you are talking to in your emails. That requires you to develop a buyer persona that gives a profile of your ideal customer/s. 

    This will guide all of your messaging not only on email but across content. It’s a level of detail about your customer that will enable you to craft emails that are relevant and of interest to the recipient, increasing the chances of engagement and conversion.
    Once you know who your personas are, you can create messaging that provides solutions to their pain points. For example, let’s say you’re a recruitment agency and your persona is just out of college with no job experience. Content of value to them would be a CV and resume clinic or a meeting with one of your consultants. 

    In addition, to target the right people with the right message you need to segment your lists. </p>

       <h2>Step 2: Come up with a powerful subject line</h2>
       <img src="/images/tc4jmi4v.bmp" alt="">
       <p>The subject line is the first thing a person will see in their inbox - so make it count. It’s not enough to just add an emoji and add the word ‘NEW’. It needs to be enticing enough for your audience to open it. 

        Ways to craft the perfect subject line are:
        
            Keep it short and snappy - Remember a lot of people open emails on their mobile, and content gets cut off at a certain length so keep it to the point. 
            Add personalization - This could include adding the person’s first name or the name of a product or course they showed interest in.
            Tell them what’s inside - Try to give a hint as to what content they will get when opening the email, it will prompt interest. 
            Take inspiration from successful ones - You probably have emails in your inbox that made you click. Review and analyze them to see what they did right and why you opened them. 
            Ask a question - People love to be asked for their opinion so ask a question in your subject line to see how it performs. 
            Consider emojis - Emojis are fun and can appeal to an audience. But be careful how you use them and what you use. Make sure they are relevant to the subject line and audience. 
            Include action verbs - Using action verbs is more powerful than using a passive voice. So instead of ‘’New podcast on SEO’ write ‘Listen to our new SEO podcast with X’. 
            Integrate FOMO - People love to be in the loop, so try to use a subject line that taps into a fear of missing out (FOMO). In other words, if you don't open this, you’ll miss out!
        
        These points are particularly important if you’re writing a cold marketing email as you know very little about your prospect, so crafting a great subject line will help drive open rates. 
        
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3: Personalize the message</h2>
    <p>A study, ‘The Rise of Personalized Commerce’ found that 70 percent of companies that use advanced personalization earned a 200 percent return on investment from it. That’s because personalization works when done properly. 

        By using segmentation you can group your email mail list into distinct groups and then craft content that is important or relevant to them. Or be clever about your copy and catch a range of personas like in this email marketing example from Cole Haan. The important thing is that people feel special and you have thought about their needs.
        Including a name is the first place to start either in the subject line or in the first line of your email. Nobody wants to read ‘Dear sir’ anymore. You can also personalize based on past purchases. If they bought this type of product, they may be interested in a similar one if you tell them about it. 

        This also counts for downloadable assets or events such as live webinars. If they downloaded an ebook for example then you could retarget them with a blog, webinar or podcast on the same or similar topic.  </p>
        <h2>Step 4: Establish a relationship with your prospects & customers</h2>
        <p>The key strength of email is that it allows you to build relationships with your customers and prospects. It allows you to tell them things about your brand or product and service they may not have known otherwise. 

            Use this opportunity to tell them more about your business or make it more personal. An email from your CEO that talks about the goals or ethics of your business could work well. Or offer VIP access or early bird discounts to your email list before anyone else to show them you care about their interest and commitment. 
            
            It’s wise to also use personal language like ‘you’ or ‘your’ to treat them like an important part of your business or even a friend of your brand. This is a great example of using that tactic from Glassdoor. </p>
